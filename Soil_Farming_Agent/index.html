        <p>
          Earth is made up of various elements that contribute to the whole
          ecosystem. The main elements of nature on which our survival depends
          are water, land, air, and soil. Water is used for drinking purposes,
          land for habitats, air for oxygen, and soil for the consumption of
          food through agriculture. Agriculture plays a very important role in
          the Indian Economy as it is the backbone of our country. Nearly 70% of
          the Indian population depends on agriculture for food and money. In
          order to obtain sustainable food crops, it is very important to
          maintain the good quality of the soil. Soil plays a crucial role in
          providing nutrients to the plants, storing and filtering rainwater,
          providing water to various crops, and preventing pollution.<br /><br />
          What is Soil? <br />
          Soil is the surface material composed of various organic matters,
          minerals, and microorganisms that is found on the uppermost layer of
          the earths crust. They provide structural support to the plants that
          are used in the agricultural processes and are also the prime source
          of various nutrients, minerals, and water. Soils differ in their
          chemical and physical properties depending on the climate and regions
          they are found in. Each soil has unique properties which are
          favourable for various practices such as agriculture. The physical
          characteristics of soil include texture, colour, structure, porosity,
          etc. <br /><br />Types of Soils:<br />
          There are different types of soil found in various parts of the
          country. They are as follows: <br />
          Black Cotton Soil, Laterite Soil, Mountainous or Forest Soil, Arid or
          Desert Soil, Alluvial Soil, Peaty and Marshy Soil, Saline and Alkaline
          Soil. <br /><br />What are Crops?<br />
          Crops are plants that are cultivated and harvested by the farmers
          during the agricultural process. The cultivation of crops depends
          mainly on climate conditions and soil. <br /><br />
          Types of Crops: <br />There are different types of crops grown
          depending on the type of conditions and regions they are grown in.
          They are as follows: <br />
          Kharif Crops, Rabi Crops, Zaid Crops, Cash Crops, Food Crops.
